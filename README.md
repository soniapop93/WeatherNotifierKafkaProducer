## What the script does

**Kafka Producer**:

- gets the IP address of user using [API](https://ipinfo.io/ip)
- gets the latitude and longitude values from this [API](https://api.techniknews.net/ipgeo/${ip})
- uses this weather free [API](https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=$value&longitude=$value&hourly=precipitation_probability&current_weather=true)
- it makes requests on the API every 5 mins to get new data
- checks the weather for the current hour
- if the precipitation probability changed for the current hour will creates a message to be sent to Kafka
